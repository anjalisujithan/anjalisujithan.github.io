This project explores images with zoom. The first row of images shows how a portrait of a person zoomed in looks much more curved and less proportional than a picture of the same person zoomed in from farther away.

The GIF shows an example of Dolly zoom on a tree outside of VLSB on Berkeley's campus. We can observe that as I moved awawy from the tree but zoomed in to make the tree the same size consistently, the background got larger. By overlaying the images this creates a distorted video that shows the tree unmoving but the background getting larger.
